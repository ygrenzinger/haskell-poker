# extreme poker hand kata :)

Using QuickCheck to generate hand for each category and an invariant property which test that any hand with a superior category should win.

Added typical unit tests for finding hand category but also for comparing the special cases of two players with the same hand category

If somebody has ideas to improve this code or propose new property invariants, don't hesitate !
